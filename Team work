Team work is the effort of a group to achieve a comman goal or 
to complete a task in the most efficient way. Team work is not a new concept.

I still remember the story of "Team work" which my father told me in my childhood from PANCHATANTRA book.
Where even a lion cannot attack a herd of cows when they are in one group but it kills one by one all cows
when they are seperated and live alone due to conflicts.

So, Team work have many benefits like we can share our knowledge with others and also can learn new things
from our team members, there will be a healthy competition between the group members which finally result
in improving the Productivity of the work, developing relationships and many more.
