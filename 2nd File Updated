GitHub is a hosting service for the Git repository, but adds many of its own features. Although Git is 
a command line tool, GitHub provides a graphical interface based on the Web. It also provides access
 control and other shared features for each group, such as a wikis, and simple task management tools.

GitHub's main feature is "forking"-transferring a file from the account of one user to another. 
This allows you to take a project that you don't have access to in writing and to modify it under 
your own account. If you are making changes that you would like to share, you may send the original 
owner a notification called a "pull request." The user can then fuse the changes found in your repo 
with the original repo with a click of a button.

These three functions-fork, pull request and merge-make GitHub so powerful. If you wanted to contribute
 to an open source project, you had to download the source code for the project manually, make your 
 changes locally, create a list of changes called a "patch" and then email the patch to the project 
 maintainer. The maintainer would then have to evaluate this patch, possibly sent by a total stranger, 
 and decide whether to merge the changes.
