Web development is website building and maintaining; it's the work behind the scenes to make a 
website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.

Software developers, or 'devs' use a number of coding languages to do this. The languages they use 
depend on the types of tasks they perform, and the platforms they work on.

Web development skills are worldwide in high demand and well-paid-making development a great career 
option. It is one of the most readily accessible higher paying fields because you don't need a typical 
university degree to graduate.
