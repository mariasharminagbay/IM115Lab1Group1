In this assignment, my teammate created a new repository.

To create a new repository in github, click on create new and name it. 
After that, we have to invite members to collaborate. Once they accepth the invitation, they can work on the repository and seperate branches will be created for each collaborator.

First, I have created a folder in master branch. Later I will create 3 to 4 files in my branch and 
perform tasks like removing file, merging file, deleting, and pulling requests.
