At GitHub's heart is Git, an open source project started by Linux creator Linus Torvalds.Git handles
and stores project updateslike other version control systems. Although it is mostly used for code, Git
might be used to manage any other file type, such as Word documents or Final Cut projects. 
For every draft of a document think of it as a filing system.

Some of Git’s predecessors, such as CVS and Subversion, have a central “repository” of all the files 
associated with a project. When a developer makes changes, those changes are made directly to the 
central repository. With distributed version control systems like Git, if you want to make a change 
to a project you copy the whole repository to your own system.

You make your changes on your local copy, then the changes to the central server are "checked in" 
This encourages more granular changes to be shared, as you don't have to connect to the server every 
time you change it.
