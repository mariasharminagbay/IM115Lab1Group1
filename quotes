Faith and prayer both are invisible, but they make impossible things possible.

With our thoughts we make the world.

The root of suffering is attachement.

The mind is everything, what you thik, you become.

If you light a lamp for somebody, it will also brighten your path.

When it hurts, observe. Life is trying to teach you something.

No matter how hard the past, you can always begin again.

The mind is like water.When it's turbulent, it's difficult to see.
When it's calm,everything becomes clear.
